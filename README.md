TESTIMONIALS
​“I decided to go with Affordable  Wind  Turbines because they had the newest technology.  They’re also turn-key — they took everything from permitting to construction, through operating and maintenance once its up and running.  They’re there now and they’re there to take care of us in the future.”


It’s a simple concept: less wind needed to make it spin and you more power out of it.

But the execution took some doing. We wanted to produce more power in a wider variety of wind speeds and locations. The turbines, in any size, needed to be lightweight, efficient and affordable.

We do all that with a patented blade technology and novel design that leapfrogs standard approaches to blade shape, materials, and form factor.

About the Affordable Wind Turbines Vawt

Capturing Clean, Affordable Wind Energy with Power …

Affordable Wind Turbines Vawt™ was developed for both residential use and utility scale projects including entire communities, neighborhoods or agricultural groups coming together on a project basis to generate power. The rooftop or pole mounted Affordable Wind Turbines Vawt™ is an affordable, quiet and powerful, bird safe, scalable wind turbine system.

![1 kw unit on house3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/126938453/222878034-958f726c-4403-4536-9ec7-5aac922e3082.png)

Scalability: You can start with one Affordable Wind turbines Vawt turbine and add more turbines per pole, and more poles as your power needs grow- without the cost, time or materials waste of major construction. We call multiple Affordable Wind turbines Vawt configurations Wind Orchards. Locally, the benefits would be the capability to easily generate power and have off-grid emergency power for any neighborhood.

Because of the unique wind turbulence smoothing capability of the blades, the Affordable Wind turbines Vawt is an ‘urban tolerant’ wind turbine.

Affordable Wind turbines Vawt can be retrofit to any utility pole, unused utility poles, or retrofit to other wind turbine poles.

Availability is critical to our business model. Once in production we will have the capability to manufacture several thousand turbines a month from one manufacturing operation. Future goals include expanding manufacturing of the Affordable Wind turbines Vawt worldwide, especially in areas of critical need of economic development and energy.

The Affordable Wind turbines Vawt, Features:
Captures a higher amount of potential wind energy per diameter of swept area
Operates at slower RPM with higher load-to-torque conversion for harnessing a broader range of wind velocities.
Made of durable, ultra-light materials which have established outdoor lifespans in excess of 25 years.
Silent operation with little or no vibrations.
Shape is easily visible and non-Lethal to birds.
Higher aesthetic design value for public areas.
Lightweight materials that lower shipping costs substantially.
Self-Directing Blade design that allows energy production in turbulent wind conditions.

Affordable Wind turbines Technology,

is a revolutionary new way to connect electronic products – an “energy operating system” that enables smart buildings to make our lives more secure and our energy cleaner and more affordable. the vertical axis wind turbines uses advanced power electronics to transmit both power and information on the same wires, helping our buildings produce, store, and manage power more efficiently. Our Advanced technology is at the heart of all of Affordable Wind turbines Energy’s products.

Self-generation of clean power by consumers is transforming the global energy landscape, but the power grid is far from ready.
Consider three surprising electricity facts:

Electricity customers in Hawaii could save over 70% by using wind and solar panels – but the utility won’t allow it, because the grid is bottlenecked.
Many commercial building owners pay double for electricity from ‘demand charges’ – but they can’t avoid them without compromising their operations.
A rooftop wind and or PV system is a great way to cut energy costs.

The grid is broken, and power customers are paying the price. In each case the solution is the same: smart grid technology that gives customers options, security, and savings.
Benefits for Homeowners: Savings and Security

Affordable Wind Turbines Energy’s smart grid helps homeowners enjoy secure power and cost savings. Our wind turbines are built to help homeowners generate their own clean power, which is now the most affordable energy source in many places. But conventional renewable energy systems won’t keep your home powered during a blackout or grid failure. smart grid is designed to incorporate battery storage, so your lights stay on and your furnace keeps running without the noise and hassle of a backup generator. And if your lifestyle takes you beyond the grid, smart grid enables wind and solar power systems that provide balanced power day or night, all year around.
Benefits for Commercial Buildings: Scalable Secure Power


Secure power isn’t optional in today’s competitive business environment, where a few lost days can mean the difference between profit and peril. smart grid enables smarter buildings that generate their own power, store and deliver energy to avoid demand charges and ride through blackouts, and prioritize power to your most critical functions. Affordable Wind turbines Energy partners with leading solution providers to offer scalable building energy systems that deliver savings and security.
Why is our technology better?
Designed for Smart grids

our products are designed to turn grid-dependent buildings into Smart grids – energy networks that combine energy sources, storage, and loads to allow operation independent of the grid. The Smart grid wind turbines was designed to plug-and-play, making it easy to combine different sources to build secure, efficient, cost-effective energy systems for homes and businesses. Because our buildings will increasingly produce as well as consume energy (the “Prosumer” model), affordable wind turbines products are built on bi-directional power electronics that can buy, sell, or store power efficiently.
Smarter Wires and the Internet of Things

Affordable Wind Turbines’s approach delivers both energy and system information over the same wires, making every product on the network a smart node in the ‘Internet of Things.’ Abundance of power is signaled by the voltage of the grid, making it simple to deliver powerful capabilities, like heating water when energy is plentiful, and selling power when prices are highest.

The electrical grid we use today was designed in 1890 – one hundred years before the digital revolution – and hasn’t changed much since then. It makes and uses Alternating Current (AC), but almost every modern appliance and computer needs Direct Current (DC) to run, and today’s new clean power systems (like solar, wind, fuel cells, and electric vehicles) produce DC as well. AC adapters and converters waste valuable power, clutter our desks, and make it hard to build smarter electric grids. Affordable Wind turbines Energy asked, “what would electricity distribution look like if it were designed for today’s energy sources and loads?”

Less Energy Loss

Built for Clean Power, Energy Storage, and EVs

Buying an electric vehicle is a great way to promote energy independence and greener transportation, especially if you produce your own clean electrons with wind or solar.

Affordable Wind turbines Energy is excited to work with businesses, homeowners, product designers, and researchers who share our vision for a safer, cleaner world.
